So, GSAP is awesome. I can only imagine how much this simplifies the animation process, especially with the whole chaining process via timeline. There already seems to be a bunch of pre-built animations, too, so that's pretty awesome. It also heavily reduces the need to think about animations while doing the styling AND it does seem less verbose than building animations via CSS and JavaScript. It's just...awesome

But of course, it seemed too good to be true. I wondered why I didn't hear about it at all during my several months of learning to code, and only did hear about it very recently (although even then I don't recall exactly how). And yeah it turns out that it's simply not that popular. I thought about learning it for an upcoming client project, but given the demands of my client and the need to make the page as performant as possible, using something that he would consider to be "bloat" is not an option.

And that's the downside of it. It's simply bloat. Admittedly I can definitely build any page and any animation with just vanilla, so for performance and to reduce dependencies, avoiding bloat is the best way. 

Still, GSAP is just magic and I don't want to downplay how game-changing it can be. It actually got me interested in checking out other animation frameworks since apparently, there's a sizeable number out there waiting to be explored. I liked it, and I will definitely try to build projects for my portfolio with it.
